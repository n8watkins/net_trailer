## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Phase 2A)

### Step 1: Get Your TMDB API Key (5 minutes)
1. Go to https://www.themoviedb.org/
2. Create free account
3. Go to Settings → API → Request API Key
4. Replace `PLACEHOLDER_GET_YOUR_FREE_TMDB_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
5. Test: `pnpm dev` - movies should load

### Step 2: Test Full Functionality (10 minutes)
- [ ] Homepage loads with movie data
- [ ] Movie thumbnails display correctly
- [ ] Authentication works (login/signup)
- [ ] Modal opens when clicking movies
- [ ] No console errors

## 🔧 PHASE 2B: Critical UX Improvements (Week 1)

### Priority 1: Error Handling System (4-5 hours)
**Current issue:** Users see broken UI when API fails

**What we'll implement:**
```typescript
// Error Toast System
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic error recovery
- Loading states for better UX
- Fallback content when data fails
```

**Files to create/modify:**
- `components/ErrorToast.tsx` ✨ NEW
- `atoms/errorAtom.ts` ✨ NEW
- `hooks/useAuth.tsx` 🔄 UPDATE
- `utils/errorHandler.ts` ✨ NEW

### Priority 2: Fix Inefficient Array Randomization (30 minutes)
**Current issue:** Biased shuffle algorithm

**Quick fix:**
```javascript
// Current (biased)
arr.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)

// Better (Fisher-Yates)
function shuffleArray(array) {
    for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
        [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
    }
    return array;
}
```

### Priority 3: Clean Up Dead Code (1 hour)
**Remove:**
- Console.log statements in `reset.tsx` and `Modal.tsx`
- Unused imports (`type` from 'os' in `Row.tsx`)
- Commented TV interface in `typings.d.ts`

### Priority 4: Fix Hardcoded UI Positioning (2 hours)
**Current issue:** `top-[50em]` breaks on different screen sizes

**Solution:** Convert to responsive design
```css
/* Instead of hardcoded positioning */
.absolute.top-[50em]

/* Use responsive approach */
.relative.mt-[40vh] md:mt-[50vh] lg:mt-[60vh]
```
